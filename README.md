developed for TartanHacks2018: Nathan Kuo, Lichen Zhang, Liangze Li, Tianyi Zhu

Although we have so many recycle bins, we often see plastic 
bottles thrown into general waste, as well as paper thrown 
into plastic recycling.

Introducing.. Tad:

Tad Uses OpenCV and Google Cloud Vision API to detect trash 
on your hands and points you to the bin! 
Tad gets happy when you throw into the right bin! But..
if you approach the wrong bin.. it gets upset!
